# EDA_Student_success
This project explores the key factors influencing student academic performance and success using data-driven analysis. Through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we uncover patterns, correlations, and actionable insights that can help educators and institutions improve student outcomes.

## Objectives
* Identify which features most strongly correlate with student success
* Explore the impact of variables such as parental education, test preparation, gender, and study time
* Provide visual and statistical insights for education policy or intervention

## Tools & Technologies
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
* Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration

##Insights
* Exam Scores are influenced by Hours Studied and Attendance.
